# Battleship


Game Description/How to play:   
Prior to the start of the game, each opponent will secretly place their own five ships on the lower coordinate grid(Ocean Grid) by laying out their ships and anchoring them into the holes on the grid.Each contestant gets a game board and five ships.Each ship will have holes where the "hit" pegs a supply of hit-and-miss markers (white and red pegs). Every ship must be placed horizontally or vertically across grid spaces—not diagonally—and the ships can't hang off the grid. Ships can touch each other. However, they can't occupy the same grid space. You cannot change the position of the ships after the game begins.You and the CPU will take turns guessing row and column coordinates on the other contestant's lower coordinate grid. To identify a square that contains one of their five ships.

Carrier, which has five holes

Cruiser(which has three holes)

Submarine( which has three holes)

Destroyer(which has two holes)
